1. **Download the Add-on**
   ```
   Download: uv_total_ratio_compare_Version2.py
   ```

2. **Install in Blender**
   - Open Blender 4.5+
   - Go to `Edit` → `Preferences` → `Add-ons`
   - Click `Install...` button
   - Navigate to and select `uv_total_ratio_compare_Version2.py`

## 📖 Usage Guide

### **Basic Workflow**

#### 1. **Prepare Your Model**
```
• Select your mesh object
• Enter Edit Mode (Tab)
• Ensure your object has UV coordinates
• Switch to UV Editing workspace
```

#### 2. **Access the Tool**
```
• Open the sidebar (N key) in either UV Editor OR 3D Viewport
• Find "Nazarick UV Tools" panel (available in both locations)
• Click "Calculate UV/3D Ratio"
• Results appear instantly in BOTH panels simultaneously
```

#### 3. **Interpret Results**
The tool provides several ratio interpretations:

| Ratio Range | Status | Meaning |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| 0.99 - 1.01 | ✅ **PERFECT** | 1:1 UV to 3D ratio (ideal) |
| 1.05 - 1.5 | ⚠️ **Slightly Large** | Minor texture stretching |
| > 1.5 | 🔴 **Much Larger** | Significant texture stretching |
| 0.5 - 0.95 | ⚠️ **Slightly Small** | Minor texture compression |
| < 0.5 | 🔴 **Much Smaller** | Significant texture compression |

#### 4. **Auto-Correction (Optional)**
```
• Click "Scale UVs to Match 3D" to automatically achieve 1:1 ratio
• The tool preserves UV layout while scaling proportionally
• Results update automatically after scaling
```

### **Advanced Usage**

#### **Understanding the Calculations**
- **3D Area**: Surface area of your mesh in 3D space
- **UV Area**: Area covered by UV coordinates in UV space
- **Ratio**: UV Area ÷ 3D Area
- **Scope**: Shows whether calculation used "selected faces" or "all faces"
- **Face Count**: Number of faces processed
- **Calculation Time**: Performance measurement

#### **Selection-Based Workflow**
1. **Whole Mesh**: No selection = calculates entire mesh
2. **Selected Faces**: Select specific faces = calculates only selected geometry
3. **Mixed Selection**: Works with any face selection combination
4. **Real-time Updates**: Both panels update simultaneously when you recalculate

#### **Best Practices**
1. **Clean Geometry**: Ensure manifold geometry for accurate calculations
2. **Proper UVs**: Verify UVs are unwrapped before measuring
3. **Consistent Scale**: Apply transforms before measuring for accurate results
4. **Iterative Workflow**: Measure → Adjust → Measure → Perfect

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & FAQ

### **Common Issues**

#### **❌ "Object has no UV maps"**
**Solution**: 
- Enter Edit Mode
- Select all faces (A)
- Press `U` → `Unwrap` to create UV coordinates
- Try the calculation again

#### **❌ "Could not calculate area (3D area is zero)"**
**Solution**: 
- Check that your mesh has actual geometry
- Ensure you're not working with a plane with zero thickness
- Verify the mesh scale is reasonable (not microscopic)

#### **❌ "No active UV map found"**
**Solution**: 
- Go to Object Properties → UV Maps
- Ensure you have at least one UV map
- Make sure the UV map is set as active

#### **⚠️ Results seem incorrect**
**Solution**: 
- Apply all transforms (Ctrl+A → All Transforms)
- Check for non-manifold geometry (Select → Select All by Trait → Non-Manifold)
- Ensure consistent face normals (Mesh → Normals → Recalculate Outside)

### **Performance Tips**
- For very high-poly meshes, consider using the Decimate modifier for testing
- The tool is optimized but extremely dense meshes may take longer to process
- Results are cached until you run the calculation again

### **Compatibility**
- **Blender Versions**: Tested on 4.5.0, should work on newer versions
- **Mesh Types**: Works with any manifold mesh geometry
- **UV Types**: Compatible with all standard UV mapping methods
