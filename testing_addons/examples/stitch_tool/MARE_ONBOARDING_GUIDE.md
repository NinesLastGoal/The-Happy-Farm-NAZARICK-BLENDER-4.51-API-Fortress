## 🌿 Common Questions (Don't worry, everyone asks these!)

**Q: "Help! I don't see the Nazarick Tools panel!"**
A: Press `N` to toggle the sidebar, then look for the "Nazarick Tools" tab. If it's not there, make sure the addon is enabled in Preferences > Add-ons.

**Q: "My stitches look too big/small!"**
A: Enable "Auto Sizing" and click the refresh button - it will automatically adjust to your mesh! For manual control, try starting with very small values like 0.01.

**Q: "I selected vertices but got an error about edges?"**
A: Make sure your selected vertices are connected to each other! Think of it like connecting dots - the vertices need to form a path.

**Q: "How do I remove stitches if I made a mistake?"**
A: Don't panic! Use the "All Tagged" removal mode to safely remove all stitches. It's like an undo button just for stitches!

**Q: "I'm getting overwhelmed by all the options!"**
A: That's completely normal! Start with just the basics:
1. Select vertices
2. Create vertex group
3. Enable auto-sizing
4. Choose straight stitches
5. Click create!
