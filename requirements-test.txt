# Testing Requirements for UV3D Ratio Blender Addon
# For Blender 4.5 Development and Testing
#
# These are the Python packages needed for running tests outside of Blender
# Note: When running inside Blender, these are provided by Blender's bundled Python

# Core testing framework (usually included with Python)
# unittest  # Built-in with Python

# For advanced mocking if needed
# mock  # Built-in with Python 3.3+

# Documentation and code quality (optional)
# pylint>=2.15.0
# flake8>=4.0.0
# black>=22.0.0

# Note: This addon is designed for Blender 4.5 which includes:
# - Python 3.11.x (bundled with Blender)
# - bpy module (Blender Python API)
