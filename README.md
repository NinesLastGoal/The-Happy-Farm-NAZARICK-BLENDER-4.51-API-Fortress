# UV3D-Ratio-Blender-4.5-Nazarick-Edition
Created to help with the sewing toolbox from  Alexandre Albisser he mentions that the ratio between the uv map and 3d size is important but i have no idea how to do that manually so made an addon that appears in the UV editor only right hand panel. Seems to work for me i dunno if youll have problems. HAIL AINZ OOAL0000 GOWN!
